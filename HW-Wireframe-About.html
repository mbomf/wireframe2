            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <br>
            <p>Just turned 22! I am very excited to immerse myself in the endless possibilities that coding has to offer. I really enjoy applying 
                the elements to design and I have a great time applying what I'm learning to practical issues that I face everyday. The beauty about coding
                is that every project can be different and has it's own personality. I have a great time applying practical skills learned here 
                to the ever changing world. 
                <br><br>
                My name is Marco Brugo Onetti and, although I was born in Buenos Aires, Argentina, I have lived here in the United States for a grand majority
                of my life. I have lived in most of my time in Miami in the island of Key Biscayne, where I was raised. I now reside in Brickell, downtown Miami. 
                I have always made effort to visit every stretch of the city and I have come to know a great deal about the place, so much so I would Miami my home. 
                I love discovering new places the most, however, and traveling is always on my mind, weather within the city, state, country and most entertaining of all the world. 
                <br><br>
                My lifelong goal would be to visit every single country in the world. I feel like this feat is not only very possible, as others have been able to conquer it.
                but also because of how wonderous it sounds. One thing I have noticed from some famous people that have already completed the trip is that they happened to 
                concentrate on going all over the world as fast as possible which to me was counterintuitive. Part of visiting every place is the journey, and I 
                feel I have the patience to do it over the course of my lifetime, and that the wonderful experiences I have when traveling can influence how I integrate design and development.
